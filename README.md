# Prims-Implementation
This Python script leverages NumPy, Pandas, NetworkX, and Matplotlib to create a random weighted graph with a specified number of nodes and edges. The density of the graph is adjustable, allowing users to generate both dense and sparse graphs. The script then applies Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree, emphasizing the minimum set of edges needed to connect all nodes. The original graph and the resulting minimum spanning tree are visually represented using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

Key Features:

    Random weighted graph generation with customizable density.
    Implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.
    Visualization of the original graph and the minimum spanning tree using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
